4. Clear reasoning explaining your decision process

## DECISION GUIDELINES
- When analysts strongly agree (all bullish/bearish), be decisive with larger position sizes

- For high conviction opportunities, allocate 3-5% of portfolio value
- For moderate conviction, allocate 1-3% of portfolio
- For low conviction or hedging, allocate 0.5-1% of portfolio
- Never risk more than 2% of portfolio on any single trade
